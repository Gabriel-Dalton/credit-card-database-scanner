- 🎉 Stylish, state-of-the-art UI straight out of the early 2000s.

- 🛡️ A guaranteed message telling you your card is safe! (It's all part of the joke, don’t worry!)

   git clone https://github.com/Gabriel-Dalton/credit-card-database-scanner.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser. That’s it. You’re now a cybersecurity expert. 🎓

## How to Use 🤓

1. Enter any fake (or real if you’re feeling adventurous, but please don’t) credit card number, expiration date, and zip code into the form.
2. Hit the **SCAN DATABASE** button.
3. Watch the magic happen as it “scans” hacker databases.
4. Feel relieved when the software tells you your card is safe. Wow, that was easy!

## Why Was This Made? 🤔

The real question is: **Why not?** Sometimes, we need a little humor in the world of cybersecurity. 🤷‍♂️

## Disclaimer ⚠️

This project is a **joke** and meant for entertainment purposes only. It’s not secure, doesn’t actually scan anything, and is in no way affiliated with any real security service.
