# UltraSecure™ Credit Card Safety Scanner 🔒

Welcome to the **UltraSecure™ Credit Card Safety Scanner**! This top-tier, totally legitimate software allows you to "check" if your credit card number is in a hacker's database! Don't worry, our super advanced and definitely-not-made-in-HTML technology will make sure your card number is 100% safe.*

> 🚨 **Disclaimer**: This is 100% a joke. Please do NOT enter real credit card information. It won’t end well. Seriously, this is a parody project meant for laughs! 🚨

## Features 💥

- 🎉 Stylish, state-of-the-art UI straight out of the early 2000s.
- ⏳ Realistic loading bar for that extra touch of “legitimacy.”
- 🛡️ A guaranteed message telling you your card is safe! (It's all part of the joke, don’t worry!)

## How to Install 🚀

1. Clone the repo (we know, super complicated stuff here):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Gabriel-Dalton/credit-card-database-scanner.git
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser. That’s it. You’re now a cybersecurity expert. 🎓

## How to Use 🤓

1. Enter any fake (or real if you’re feeling adventurous, but please don’t) credit card number, expiration date, and zip code into the form.
2. Hit the **SCAN DATABASE** button.
3. Watch the magic happen as it “scans” hacker databases.
4. Feel relieved when the software tells you your card is safe. Wow, that was easy!

## Contributing 🤡

Sure, go ahead and make a pull request. Maybe you can help us scan even more non-existent hacker databases! Or perhaps you'd like to add more hilarious features to make this "security software" even more believable. Just remember to keep it fun!

## Why Was This Made? 🤔

The real question is: **Why not?** Sometimes, we need a little humor in the world of cybersecurity. 🤷‍♂️

## Disclaimer ⚠️

This project is a **joke** and meant for entertainment purposes only. It’s not secure, doesn’t actually scan anything, and is in no way affiliated with any real security service. Do not input any real personal or financial information. We are not responsible for any consequences of actually trying to use this as a security tool (seriously, don’t).
